I need a basic communication between a PC and three ev3 boards using Bluetooth, I need to broadcasting the data using advertisements, I want to send just strings, and I have a code for the PC and for the EV3s that I need that you check and make the adjustments to achieve the goal, please avoid the format ( f"string {DATA}" ), and from the ev3 code I got the following error

error: Failed to register advertisement: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: Method "RegisterAdvertisement" with signature "sa{sv}" on interface "org.bluez.LEAdvertisingManager1" doesn't exist



running EV3 code I got the error:
ValueError: invalid UUID specified in service_classes

how can solve that, keeping the same simpicity of the code knowing the following ev3 packages inf:

BlueZ version:  5.43
Found Bluetooth adapter at  /org/bluez/hci0
Bluetooth LE advertising not supported on this device
Available tools: hcitool btmon  bluetoothctl

can you provide me with code to connect through Bluetooth my ubunutu pc with 3 ev3dev lego mindstorms broadcasting the data with advertisments, in the most simple way, considering that I have problems with dbus, and some tries has worked just with bluetooth.ble, I just want to send strings, and the format  f"T:{temp:.1f},L:{light:.1f}" doesn't work


(base) $ hcitool scan

dpkg -l | grep bluez


python3 bluetooth_lib/pc_second_server_blut_v2.py       Connection works just for one
